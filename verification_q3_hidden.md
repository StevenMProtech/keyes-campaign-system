# Question 3 Hidden - Verification Results

## Date: October 28, 2025

## Task: Hide Question 3 from campaign creation form to reduce friction

### Changes Made:

1. **File: /home/ubuntu/keyes-system/templates/campaign_new_complete.html**
   - Wrapped entire Question 3 section (lines 430-460) in `<div style="display: none;">` container
   - This hides all Question 3 fields from the form builder

2. **File: /home/ubuntu/keyes-system/app.py**
   - Removed `{q3_html}` from both preview template rendering locations:
     - Line ~1662: Old preview template (removed from form section)
     - Line ~1851: New preview template (removed from form section)
   - Question 3 will no longer appear in campaign email previews

### Verification Results:
