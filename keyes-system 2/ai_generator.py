# All 25 Harry Dry Principles
HARRY_DRY_PRINCIPLES = """
1. Add warmth to CTA (face image, name, reassurance - "friendly tour, not a sales pitch")
2. Don't use adjectives if possible
3. Don't make the client think - presets are best when segmenting
4. Don't show a logo, show the transformation
5. Tease the content in ads
6. Show the product in action
7. Make the copy shorter
8. Don't write AT the readers
9. Use your customers' words
10. Load up on personal pronouns (you, your, we)
11. Don't worry about grammar
12. Start sentences with conjunctions (And, But, So)
13. Don't persuade - let the reader be persuaded
14. Use contractions (we'll, you've, it's)
15. Don't imitate
16. Ditch the thesaurus
17. Empathize
18. Respect the competition
19. Don't try too hard
20. Tell stories
21. Read it aloud
22. Differentiate through contrast (point at status quo)
23. Invent a new category (no competitors)
24. Go all-in on one niche or feature
25. Positioning needs a story behind it
