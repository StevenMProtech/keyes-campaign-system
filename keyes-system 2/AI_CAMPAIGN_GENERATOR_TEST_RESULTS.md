### 4. Test Case: General Past Clients Segment

**Generated Content:**

**Subject Line:** "{{contact.firstname}}, you've got $350K+ ready to work for you"

**Headline:** "Your home has changed. What's next?"

**Subheadline:** "Let's find the right move for your life today"

**Body Copy:** "We helped you find your last home. And life's brought changes since then. Maybe the kids are growing or you're thinking about moving closer to family. Or maybe work has shifted and your home no longer fits. So what now? You've built equity — but what's the smart move? We get it. You want a plan that fits your life and timing. And not just any plan, one that feels right. Let's talk through your options — no pressure, just a friendly conversation about what comes next for you."

**CTA Button:** "Show me my best options"

**Callout Box:**
- Title: "Homes moved since 1976"
- Main Text: "$2.28B sold"
- Subtitle: "Imagine what your home's worth now"

**Question 1:** "What's next for you?"
- Subtitle: "Pick what fits — we'll send you a plan"
- Options:
  1. "Upgrade my home" - "Need more space or better fit"
  2. "Downsize" - "Simplify life or reduce costs"
  3. "Relocate" - "Closer to work or family"
  4. "Invest or second home" - "Put equity to work"

**Question 2:** "What matters most to you?"
- Subtitle: "Check all that apply"
- Options:
  1. "Timing flexibility"
  2. "Financial sense"
  3. "Trust and guidance"
  4. "Life fit"

**Question 3:** "When are you thinking about this?"
- Subtitle: "No pressure — just helps us help you"
- Options:
  1. "Within 3 months"
  2. "3 to 6 months"
  3. "6 to 12 months"
  4. "Not sure yet"

**Explanation:** "This email works because it speaks directly to past clients experiencing life changes — growing families, career moves, or downsizing — without making them think. It uses Harry Dry's principles by showing transformation (what their home equity can do), telling their story, and letting them choose their path with clear presets. The warm, personal call-to-action with Jamie's name reassures and invites a friendly chat, not a sales pitch. We avoid jargon and adjectives, keep sentences short, start with conjunctions, and use personal pronouns to make it conversational. Unlike generic real estate emails focused on listings or company features, this campaign centers on the client's life stage and choices, building on trust from past relationships and offering real, flexible options tailored to their current needs."

### 5. Harry Dry Principles Applied

The AI successfully applies these principles:
1. ✅ Show transformation

6. ✅ Short sentences
7. ✅ Start with conjunctions (And, Or, So)
8. ✅ Avoid jargon and adjectives
9. ✅ Conversational tone
10. ✅ Clear call-to-action
11. ✅ Social proof (49 years, $2.28B sold)
12. ✅ Specificity (dollar amounts, timeframes)

### 6. Technical Implementation

**JavaScript Auto-Fill Logic:**
- Fetches AI-generated content from `/api/generate-campaign`
- Automatically populates all form fields
- Handles nested objects (callout_box, form_questions)
- Displays loading state during generation
- Shows explanation panel after completion
- Smooth scroll to form after generation

**API Response Format:**
```json
{
  "subject_line": "...",
  "headline": "...",
  "subheadline": "...",
  "body_copy": "...",
