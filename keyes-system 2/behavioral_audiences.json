However, it does not include typical web visitor journey metrics such as:\n\n- Number of unique visitors or sessions\n- Pages viewed per visit\n- Time spent on site\n- Page URLs or page names visited\n- Interaction sequences or conversion event tracking\n- Drop-off or exit pages\n\nWithout explicit web analytics data (page views, timestamps, session IDs, event tracking), it is not possible to compute or infer:\n\n- Total unique visitors (the dataset shows many homeowner records but no direct visitor/session IDs)\n- Average pages per visit\n- Average time on site\n- Top visited pages\n- Conversion paths\n- Drop-off points\n- Engagement levels based on web behavior\n- Intent signals derived from web interactions\n- Behavioral patterns of site usage or navigation flows\n\n---\n\n### What the data DOES provide:\n\n- Homeowner demographic and property attributes (age, marital status, language, home type, lot size, bedrooms, bathrooms)\n- Property financials (AVM value, sale price, mortgage info)\n- Residential tenure (length of residence)\n- Lifestage clusters (e.g., \"Great Xpectations\", \"X in the City\")\n- Flags for foreclosure, vacancy, remodeling\n- Contact info and DNC status\n\n### Behavioral insights that can be derived from the provided data:\n\n1. **Demographic and Lifestage Segmentation**:\n   - Majority homeowners fall into clusters like \"Great Xpectations\" and \"X in the City,\" indicating family-oriented, established residents.\n   - Ages range widely, with many between 30-70.\n   - High incidence of children (\"Child\" = Y) signifies family households.\n   - Marital status varies but many are married or single with families.\n\n2. **Homeownership and Property Characteristics**:\n   - Most dwellings are single-family homes (DWELLING_TYPE = 'S').\n   - Homes built mostly between 1970s and 2000s, with some remodeled in last 12 months.\n   - Average bedrooms around 3-4, bathrooms 2+, lot sizes vary.\n   - AVM values range widely, from ~$150K for condos to over $1M for large family homes.\n\n3. **Mortgage and Sales Patterns**:\n   - Many recent sales with mortgage loans, typical loan terms 15-30 years, interest rates mostly 3-7%.\n   - Some owners have no mortgage (loan amount = 0).\n   - A few properties flagged for pre-foreclosure or REO, indicating distress signals.\n\n4. **Language and Ethnicity**:\n   - English is dominant, with some Spanish and other languages represented.\n   - Reflects a diverse community with potential multicultural targeting.\n\n5. **Length of Residence**:\n   - Many residents have lived 5-15+ years, indicating stable, long-term occupancy.\n   - Some shorter tenure indicating recent movers.\n\n---\n\n### Since the dataset lacks visitor web journey data, I will provide a JSON output focused on behavioral insights derived from the homeowner/property data, and note the limitations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"total_visitors\": \"Data not available (no unique visitor/session IDs)\",\n  \"avg_pages_per_visit\": \"Data not available (no page view data)\",\n  \"avg_time_on_site\": \"Data not available (no time stamps or session duration data)\",\n  \"top_pages\": \"Data not available (no page URLs or page names)\",\n  \"conversion_paths\": \"Data not available (no web conversion tracking)\",\n  \"drop_off_points\": \"Data not available (no visitor navigation data)\",\n  \"engagement_level\": \"Cannot determine engagement on website from current data;
